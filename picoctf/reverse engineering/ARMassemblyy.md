# ARM ASSEMBLY 1
## step 1
fla9:picoCTF{0000001b}
so i referred a yt tutoria..as i had no idea what to do with file given..in that video he told..that the formalt of flag would be 000000xx..so .from running code in compiler
like gnd debugger..i got 27 ..the hexadecimal value of it is 1b..and thus i got the flag
## things i learmt
the code is very complex and differenct f i m planning to learn and understand..gnu debugger is used to run each code
line at a time..ansd see what o?pwe are getting
## other methods
- i directly went to the video after seeing the crazy syntax file
