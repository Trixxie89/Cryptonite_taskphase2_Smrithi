# TRANSFORMATION
## step 1
So basically in this we were given a file which contains a text of Chinese characters so first I cheque the I translated the Chinese text and I got the word shape so it was not the flag and it doesn't mean anything then I opened it in the terminal using wget download the file and according to one of the reference I looked they had read the file with the help of a python programme so first I open python and try to print the characters I mean I first opened the file in python and then in order to read the file the Chinese letters do not have ski values like English letters but they are stored in the form of Unicode characters which are basically hexadecimal numbers ending with 0X so I wrote so overd function is basically used to convert the Chinese letters into its unicode and then we want to get the hexadecimal string which makes it adds to 0X part of it and then we use end equal to in order to make print the whole thing in the same line What I got was hexadecimal code of characters and I had to go to a rapid table in order to convert it into a ASCII and got the flag
