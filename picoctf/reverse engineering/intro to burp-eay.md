#   intro to burp
So here first i used burpsuite..and used its chrome to open file..went to http req..and went to the post dashboard..from there i could see the otp=test..so
i went to repeater send req..and put a =test...this made it wrong..and actually..site was srationed to work acc to syntax..ootp=correct thing..by making a=test..it didnt do
the checking of otp..and we found a vulnerability..and got flag
