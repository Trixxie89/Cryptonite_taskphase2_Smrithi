# BUFFER OVERFLOW 0
## step 1
First we see the file and download the C programme And we can see that the C programme uses two functions get this function and stpi function ....ich have the issue of buffer overflow
 get this function and stpi function these two are functions which have the issue of buffer overflow We see that the variable buff 2 has length 16 Which is basically crazy issue that if the input that we provide whether running the C programme is greater than length 16 then buffer overflow will be happening and when and according to the
 and when and according to the When the programme crashes the flag will be printed so basically we type input with anything whose length is greater than 16 and you get the flag
 flag
## what i learnt
