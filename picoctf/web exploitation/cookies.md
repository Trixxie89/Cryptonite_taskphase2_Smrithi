# COOKIES
flag:picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}
step1:
i didnt use the webshell for the challenge.I first went to website given by them and clicked Inspect.As from my previous knowledge last ctf competitions..flags of websites are 
normally stored here..and it is a cookie flag..so i went to cookies unnder application/storagr/cookies..clicked the url and saw the value was editable..i randomly started editing..
first 50..too big..40..too big...then at last at 18 got it. and i got the flag printed in website..basically as i change value of num..its returning not this cookie..your close to
cookie..and messages like that..it was a trial and error method.



step 2:o/p flag

i learnt:
1)INSPECT tab allows us to know about all the background details of site
2)  A cookie is generally structured as a name-value pair, where the name has a value stored in it..it is used to store the language..theme..previous entries of user to make site more userfriendly
3)each cookie has a specific value entained in them..so by changing values..i was calling diff cookies having some kind of data..and the code of web was designed to respond only when cookie was value was 18.
incorrect methids:
checked the html and java for the flag..didnt find
initially did not realie value was editable..more concnetration req
references
kernelctf..had a Q where we usedInspect tab to get flag from website
