step1:
i didnt use the webshell for the challenge.I first went to website given by them and clicked Inspect.As from my previous knowledge last ctf competitions..flags of websites are 
normally stored here..and it is a cookie flag..so i went to cookies unnder application/storagr/cookies..clicked the url and saw the value was editable..i randomly started editing..
first 50..too big..40..too big...then at last at 18 got it. and i got the flag printed in website..basically as i change value of num..its returning not this cookie..your close to
cookie..and messages like that..it was a trial and error method.
step 2:o/p flag
