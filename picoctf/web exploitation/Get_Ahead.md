## what i learnt 
Purpose: The GET method is used to request a resource (like a webpage, image, or API response) from the server. It retrieves the full content of the resource in the HTTP response.
Purpose: The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it only retrieves the headers of the resource, not the body. This is often used to check resource metadata (like content type, length, or existence) without downloading the full content.
