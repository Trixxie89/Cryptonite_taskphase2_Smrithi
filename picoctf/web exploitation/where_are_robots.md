# WHERE ARE ROBOTS
## step 1
So here basically I learned about robot bots basically we have a txt file called robot txt which is basically consists of information or paths that we don't want the bot like Google or Microsoft or ....ot it will ignore it and try to enter
 the bot like Google or Microsoft or whatever browser we are using to enter into so basically in an open safer file it does not look into the contents of the robot dot exd as long as it is not a malicious bot it is malicious bot it will ignore it and try to enter So basically to get into the flag we put the ext slash robot .exe to get into the file and after that we find that it had disallow eight o....he extension and then we got the flag
 we find that it had disallow eight oh two five html so we put that as the extension and then we got the flag
