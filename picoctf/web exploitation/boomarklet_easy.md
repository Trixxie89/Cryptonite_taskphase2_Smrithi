# BOOKMARKLET
## step 1
So first bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs javascript instead of loading a web page basically the bookmarks that we do in a pc so when I launch the instance and open the web page
 so when I launch the instance and open the web page I saw that they had given us a javascript so when I researched about bookmarklet it basically by adding a new bookmarklet there is a section called url so we just have to post a javascript there and the browser itself will run the whol....een so and that is how I got the flag
 the browser itself will run the whole javascript and get the flag get the flag and give it to us as a pop up screen so and that is how I got the flag
