## step 1
So here we are given two type of files cypher text and the encoder so here the plain text which is basically the flag is converted to cypher text with the help of an encoder so in order to find the flag I have to reverse this process that is from the cypher text to flag I have to go by understanding the working
 by understanding the working Working of the encoder so first order two is to like to read the file 1 way is to use through notepad and the 2nd way is through the terminal by using wget site url and then cat cypher text..its a random bunch of uppercase and
 lowecase letters
 We do the same thing for the second encoder also t use wgt download encoder that is wgt with the url of the file which has the encoder and then we can either use cat to read the file or use V terminal that is V file name so here it is V Convert B which will allow which brings us to a terminal where we can edit the file edit delete and do whatever we want with the file
 
 ## step 2
 Now when we opened it in Y convert vi Convert dot P Y we understand the we understand that the python probe we understand the python programme. In order to understand how the python programme works we have to edit and manipulate it but we do not want to make it affect the rear file so we need to copy the convert dot py file into another file so we use the command cp file name file name to what we need to copy
 to what we need to copy
and manupulate the convert2for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    this = lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
    out += this
    prev = lookup1.index(this)

by this we are getting reverse of convert.py
that is input of convert .py abc=OBB
but o?p of convert2,py when input is OBB=abc
so we got the code that can do reverse that is iif we gove ciphertext as input to the convert2 pgm we will get the flag...when we do it instead of flag..we get a python pgm
## step3
Now we got the python programme so now what we need to do is we got a python programme with the help of the programme like cat cypher text | Python 3 convert 2.py
Now we need to input the ciphertext into this python programme and save it into a file so we do cat cypher text pipe python 3 convert .py > file.py
cat file.py | python3 file.py
and bingo got 
a
d
l
i
b
i
t
that was flag..

### what you learnt
refreshed vi commands :q,:wq,i esp
ciphertext,encoder,python pgm running
### other incorrect methods 
ran the python file.py ..led to infinite loop..so i gave input as file.py and it worked
